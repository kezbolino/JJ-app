# CLAUDE.md — JJ-app

## What this is

A personal knowledge system for Brazilian jiu-jitsu. Journal every class,
connect everything into a knowledge graph, and surface patterns in the user's
game over years.

**Call it `JJ-app`.** "BJJ Brain" appears as the title of `docs/VISION.md` but
is a working title only — it came from ChatGPT and the user has explicitly
declined to rename the repo to match it. Don't reintroduce it as the project
name.

Part of the Project Hub → `github.com/kezbolino/project-hub`.

## Shape

A **static offline PWA**, same model as `kezbolino/social-media-app` (Wingman) —
*not* a localhost Node tool like Distill. Phone-first. The user builds remotely
via browser and phone, so **don't assume a local dev setup**: anything requiring
`npm run` on their machine is the wrong choice.

**No build step, no dependencies, no framework.** Plain ES modules loaded
straight from disk. Keep it that way — it's what makes the app deployable to
any static host and editable from a phone.

## Layout

```
index.html            shell + tab bar
css/app.css           all styling; light and dark via prefers-color-scheme
js/app.js             hash router and boot
js/ontology.js        positions, roles, techniques, synonyms  ← machine copy of docs/ONTOLOGY.md
js/tagger.js          text → suggested tags (literal matching, no AI)
js/db.js              IndexedDB wrapper + migrations
js/store.js           entry CRUD and every derived query (coverage, gaps, themes)
js/backup.js          JSON export/import
js/youtube.js         link parsing and title lookup
js/ui.js              h() element builder and shared bits
js/views/*.js         home, log, map, position, library, search
sw.js                 offline cache — bump CACHE when files change
tests/smoke.mjs       end-to-end browser test
```

## Running and testing

```sh
python3 -m http.server 8099    # from the repo root
node tests/smoke.mjs           # needs Playwright; drives a real browser
```

The smoke test covers the whole loop: log a class → tags suggested → saved →
counted on the dashboard → linked to its technique page → found by search →
turns into a coverage prompt. **Run it after touching anything in `js/`.**

## Rules

- **Read `docs/OPEN-QUESTIONS.md` before adding features.** §13 (where data
  lives) is still open and outranks new functionality.
- **`js/ontology.js` and `docs/ONTOLOGY.md` must stay in step.** The markdown is
  the human copy that the user reviews; the JS is what runs.
- **Bump `CACHE` in `sw.js`** whenever you add, remove or rename a file under
  `js/` or `css/`, and add new files to `SHELL`. Otherwise returning users get
  a stale app.
- Never render user content as HTML. `h()` in `js/ui.js` makes text nodes;
  don't reach for `innerHTML`.
- This repo is **private**. Free GitHub Pages does not serve private repos, so
  there is no deployment path yet (§8) — either flip it public or host on
  Cloudflare/Netlify/Vercel. Public *code* does not mean public *notes*:
  journals live in browser storage, not in the repo.

## The one design decision that must not be got wrong

Coverage asymmetry ("you've written a lot about half guard sweeps — how's your
half guard passing?") needs **position × role** in the data model, not a flat
tag list. A gap is an empty cell next to a full one. This is already built —
see `docs/DATA-MODEL.md` — and it must survive any refactor.

Related discipline: the app reports what has been **written about**, never what
the user is **good at**. Note volume is attention, not skill. Don't let a
feature quietly start claiming competence.

## Known traps

- **Data loss is the live risk.** IndexedDB on one device, no sync. Export in
  Library is the only safety net until §13 is built.
- **Cold start.** Most features need months of data. The dashboard was designed
  to be useful from day one; keep it that way.
- **Capture friction is the whole product.** If logging a class gets slower,
  nothing downstream gets data. Guard this over everything else.
- **Gap prompts need a threshold.** Below 3 entries in a sibling role, an empty
  role means nothing — flagging it just makes noise.
- **Reuse from Distill:** `kezbolino/distill` has a single `LLMProvider`
  interface with a keyless `mock` provider. Use it when tagging goes AI.

## Session log

- 2026-07-27 — Repo created (private, `main`). Captured product vision and open
  questions as docs. No code, no stack decision.
- 2026-07-27 — Scope sharpened with the user. Dashboard is the front door;
  annual wrapped demoted to nice-to-have; "Evidence" radar reframed from
  competence to coverage asymmetry (user's idea, and a better one). Wrote
  `docs/MVP.md`.
- 2026-07-27 — Shape settled: static offline PWA like Wingman, built remotely,
  not local. Gym publishes no curriculum, so the third dashboard panel became
  "recent class themes" derived from journal entries. No repo rename. Drafted
  `docs/ONTOLOGY.md` — **still needs the user's review as a practitioner**.
- 2026-07-27 — Built v0.1: the whole loop works end to end, smoke test green.
  Data still device-local; sync to a private data repo is the agreed next step
  and is not built.
