# CLAUDE.md — JJ-app

## What this is

A personal knowledge system for Brazilian jiu-jitsu. Journal every class,
connect everything into a knowledge graph, and surface patterns in the user's
game over years.

**Call it `JJ-app`.** "BJJ Brain" appears as the title of `docs/VISION.md` but
is a working title only — it came from ChatGPT and the user has explicitly
declined to rename the repo to match it. Don't reintroduce it as the project
name.

Part of the Project Hub → `github.com/kezbolino/project-hub`.

## Shape

A **static offline PWA**, same model as `kezbolino/social-media-app` (Wingman) —
*not* a localhost Node tool like Distill. Phone-first. The user builds remotely
via browser and phone, so **don't assume a local dev setup**: anything requiring
`npm run` on their machine is the wrong choice.

**No build step, no dependencies, no framework.** Plain ES modules loaded
straight from disk. Keep it that way — it's what makes the app deployable to
any static host and editable from a phone.

## Layout

```
index.html            shell + tab bar
css/app.css           all styling; light and dark via prefers-color-scheme
js/app.js             hash router and boot
js/ontology.js        shipped positions, roles, techniques, synonyms  ← machine copy of docs/ONTOLOGY.md
js/overrides.js       the user's corrections: taught words, muted words
js/tagger.js          text → suggested tags (literal matching, no AI)
js/db.js              IndexedDB wrapper + migrations
js/store.js           entry CRUD and every derived query (coverage, gaps, themes)
js/backup.js          JSON export/import
js/markdown.js        entry ↔ markdown file (the backup format)
js/sync.js            GitHub backup repo sync, via the Git Data API
js/youtube.js         link parsing and title lookup
js/ui.js              h() element builder and shared bits
js/views/*.js         home, log, map, position, library, search, settings
sw.js                 offline cache — bump CACHE when files change
tests/                markdown round-trip, app smoke test, sync test
```

## Running and testing

```sh
node tests/markdown.test.mjs    # pure node, fast
node tests/tagger.test.mjs      # pure node, fast
python3 -m http.server 8099 &   # the two browser tests need this
node tests/smoke.mjs            # Playwright; the whole app loop
node tests/sync.test.mjs        # Playwright + fake GitHub (tests/fake-github.mjs)
```

**Run all four after touching anything in `js/`.** Between them they cover the
core loop (log → tag → technique page → dashboard → coverage prompt), tagging
including user corrections, backup format fidelity, and multi-device sync
including deletions.

## Rules

- **Read `docs/OPEN-QUESTIONS.md` before adding features.** §13 (where data
  lives) is still open and outranks new functionality.
- **`js/ontology.js` and `docs/ONTOLOGY.md` must stay in step.** The markdown is
  the human copy that the user reviews; the JS is what runs.
- **Don't edit `js/ontology.js` to record the user's personal preference.** That
  is what `js/overrides.js` is for — corrections they make in-app, which sync and
  can be undone. Only change the shipped ontology for things true of BJJ
  generally, and update the markdown copy in the same commit.
- **Bump `CACHE` in `sw.js`** whenever you add, remove or rename a file under
  `js/` or `css/`, and add new files to `SHELL`. Otherwise returning users get
  a stale app.
- Never render user content as HTML. `h()` in `js/ui.js` makes text nodes;
  don't reach for `innerHTML`.
- This repo is **public** and served by GitHub Pages at
  `https://kezbolino.github.io/JJ-app/`. **No secrets, ever** — no tokens, no
  keys. The user's sync token is entered in the app and lives in their browser's
  IndexedDB; it must never reach this repo or the notes repo.
- The journal itself lives in `kezbolino/jj-app-data` (**private**), not here.
  That separation is the whole reason this repo can be public.

## The one design decision that must not be got wrong

Coverage asymmetry ("you've written a lot about half guard sweeps — how's your
half guard passing?") needs **position × role** in the data model, not a flat
tag list. A gap is an empty cell next to a full one. This is already built —
see `docs/DATA-MODEL.md` — and it must survive any refactor.

Related discipline: the app reports what has been **written about**, never what
the user is **good at**. Note volume is attention, not skill. Don't let a
feature quietly start claiming competence.

## Sync — the rules that are easy to break

Local IndexedDB is the source of truth; a private GitHub repo holds a markdown
mirror. Full detail in `docs/DATA-MODEL.md`. Three things will silently corrupt
data if forgotten:

- **Never use `saveEntry` for sync bookkeeping — use `putEntryRaw`.**
  `saveEntry` restamps `updatedAt`, which is the merge key. Restamp it during a
  sync and every entry looks permanently newer than its remote copy, so two
  devices push at each other forever.
- **Deletions need tombstones.** Delete locally, and a pull sees an id it
  doesn't recognise in the repo and puts it straight back. `store.deleteEntry`
  writes a tombstone; push converts it to a file deletion; push clears it.
- **Front matter is a fixed tiny grammar, not YAML.** We write it and we parse
  it. Don't add a YAML library or free-form fields — `tests/markdown.test.mjs`
  is what stops the backup rotting.

## Known traps

- **Notes are only as safe as the user's sync setup.** Until they add a data
  repo and token, IndexedDB on one device is all there is; Library → Export is
  the fallback.
- **Cold start.** Most features need months of data. The dashboard was designed
  to be useful from day one; keep it that way.
- **Capture friction is the whole product.** If logging a class gets slower,
  nothing downstream gets data. Guard this over everything else.
- **Gap prompts need a threshold.** Below 3 entries in a sibling role, an empty
  role means nothing — flagging it just makes noise.
- **Reuse from Distill:** `kezbolino/distill` has a single `LLMProvider`
  interface with a keyless `mock` provider. Use it when tagging goes AI.

## Session log

- 2026-07-27 — Repo created (private, `main`). Captured product vision and open
  questions as docs. No code, no stack decision.
- 2026-07-27 — Scope sharpened with the user. Dashboard is the front door;
  annual wrapped demoted to nice-to-have; "Evidence" radar reframed from
  competence to coverage asymmetry (user's idea, and a better one). Wrote
  `docs/MVP.md`.
- 2026-07-27 — Shape settled: static offline PWA like Wingman, built remotely,
  not local. Gym publishes no curriculum, so the third dashboard panel became
  "recent class themes" derived from journal entries. No repo rename. Drafted
  `docs/ONTOLOGY.md` — **still needs the user's review as a practitioner**.
- 2026-07-27 — Built v0.1: the whole loop works end to end, smoke test green.
  Data still device-local; sync to a private data repo is the agreed next step
  and is not built.
- 2026-07-27 — Built markdown sync (§13 closed). Notes mirror to a private repo
  as one .md per entry, foldered by type, with a generated index; one commit per
  sync via the Git Data API; tombstoned deletions propagate between devices.
  Added `tests/markdown.test.mjs` and `tests/sync.test.mjs` (fake GitHub). Fixed
  two bugs found by those tests: the last `## section` was dropped on parse (JS
  has no `\Z`), and pull resurrected deleted notes.
- 2026-07-28 — **Shipped.** Repo made public, GitHub Pages enabled → live at
  `https://kezbolino.github.io/JJ-app/`. Private notes repo `jj-app-data`
  created and sync configured by the user. Remember to bump `CACHE` in `sw.js`
  on every deploy now that real users (one) have the old shell cached.
- 2026-07-28 — Ontology is now correctable in-app (`js/overrides.js`): ⊘ mutes a
  wrong suggestion, "Teach a word" maps the user's vocabulary onto a technique.
  Corrections sync to the notes repo as `ontology-overrides.md` and are listed
  with undo in Settings. `suggestTags` now returns `{tag, term}` so a bad
  suggestion can be muted at source; `suggestTagsOnly` is the old shape. Added
  `tests/tagger.test.mjs`. Suite is 43 tests. sw CACHE → v3.
- 2026-07-28 — Removed the `coach` field at the user's request ("remove the
  teacher's name, it's not necessary"). Gone from the form, from display, from
  search and from the markdown front matter. `fromMarkdown` ignores the key, so
  notes already in the backup repo still parse, and their old versions remain in
  that repo's git history. **Don't reintroduce it unasked.** sw CACHE → v4.
